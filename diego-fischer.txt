Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
	An inline element has no line break before or after it, and it tolerates HTML elements next to it. A block element has some whitespace above and below it and does not tolerate any HTML elements next to it.
	
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
	An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
	
	
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
